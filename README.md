# Greetings and welcome to my GitHub! 👋 

## Introduction 🚀
Hello there! I'm Saishnu, and this is my GitHub page. I'm excited to share my projects and collaborate with amazing people on this platform.

## About Me 🤔
Completed a MSc Managing Innovation and Information Technology degree at the University of Salford, UK in September 2025. I previously graduated in May 2024 with a BSc in Computer Science from California State University, Fresno, USA. My passion and drive to learn and adapt allows me to explore the vast methods of complex problem-solving and to gain experience wherever I am. Throughout my long academic journey, I have had the opportunity to acquire a diverse skillset and apply it to various scenarios. I am firmly dedicated to any new opportunities that arise to further enhance my career goals.
